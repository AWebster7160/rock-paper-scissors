Odin Project rock paper scissors project

19/01/2024 First time creating program w/ JS from scratch. Will run rock paper scissors game in console. Later iterations will incorporate GUI.

24/01/2024 Began work on revisiting project. While the overall goal was to implement a UI, I set out to incorporate many JS utilities that I've never worked with before, primarily animation, more advanced element placement, and DOM manipulation. 

29/01/2024 Project is at a point where I am very satisfied with outcome. There are a few more aspects I would have liked to implement such as a tie message and a restart game function, and there are also some leftover animation jank that I feel is unnecessary to iron out right now. Finally, the inputs can be somewhat broken if shift+space are repeatedly entered too quickly, but it doesn't prevent the game from running correctly. I estimate that as of this update, about 15 hours were spent drawing all of the elements, and ~ 35 hours were spent programming the full page.
